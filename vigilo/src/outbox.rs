//! Durable outbox publication.
//!
//! Database workflows insert events into `outbox_events` in the same
//! transaction as state changes. The coordinator calls this module after each
//! orchestration pass to claim a bounded batch of delivery rows, publish each
//! joined event payload to the message broker, and either mark it published or
//! reschedule the delivery row for retry.
//! This keeps database state and external message delivery loosely coupled
//! without losing events when a process exits between commit and publish.
