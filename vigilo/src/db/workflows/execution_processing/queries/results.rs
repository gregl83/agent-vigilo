/// - Locks and validates the live chunk claim.
/// - Checks every completed record still owns a live worker attempt, then locks
///   that attempt with its current execution.
/// - Inserts evaluator results as append-oriented evidence; uniqueness handles
///   redelivery by turning duplicate result rows into conflicts.
/// - Upserts aggregates for completed attempts after evidence insertion.
/// - Leaves execution status changes to `finalize_execution_terminal_transitions`
///   so state mutation remains one authority-checked batch.
