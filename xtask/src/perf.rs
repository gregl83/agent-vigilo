//! External performance-harness command surface.
//!
//! The harness builds immutable release snapshots, resolves versioned workload
//! profiles, executes single-binary or counterbalanced comparison campaigns,
//! and writes machine-readable artifacts. It treats unsupported or incomplete
//! campaigns as invalid results instead of silently reducing their scope.
//!
//! # Module overview
//!
//! - `config` and `model` define the versioned input and output contracts.
//! - `build` creates immutable Vigilo snapshots and records their provenance.
//! - `schedule` and `stats` define sampling order and comparison semantics.
//! - `scaling` fits registered continuous or stepped component models, while
//!   `diagnostics` renders post-timing PostgreSQL planning, buffer, and WAL
//!   observations without changing gates.
//! - `calibration` turns canonical no-change and bounded-capacity evidence into
//!   reviewed budget/profile candidates and immutable baseline artifacts.
//! - `projection` combines bounded-capacity evidence with a named deployment
//!   input to expose resource demand, limit provenance, and confidence.
//! - `process` owns bounded child execution and platform resource collection.
//! - `service`, `fixture`, and `workload` provision isolated dependencies,
//!   render deterministic inputs, execute service-backed workloads, and apply
//!   exact correctness oracles.
//! - `command` orchestrates run and comparison campaigns; `artifact` persists
//!   checkpoints, and `report` derives human-readable views from JSON results.
//! - `check` validates these contracts and isolation boundaries without
//!   provisioning benchmark services.
//!
//! `build` and campaign commands share a workspace lease. A measured sample is
//! accepted only after its process result and workload oracle are valid; timing
//! alone never makes a sample successful.
